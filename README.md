Replication code for our seminar project Machine Learning on the extension of Diebold and Shin (2019).
There are three files included in this folder:

H1_gdp.csv: This is the main data file, containing data from 1999 till 2016 (no data extension till 2023 unfortunately!)

seminar_lasso: This file contains the code written in Python replicating and extending the original paper, using the LASSO model as step 1. 

seminar_elasticnet2: This file contains the code used for replicating and extending the original paper, using the Elastic Net model as step 1. 

dm_test.py: This file contains the code to perform the Diebold Mariano tests, do note that this is NOT written by me, the repository where this file originates from can be found below.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
